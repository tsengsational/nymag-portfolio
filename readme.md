# New York Magazine Portfolio

This is a repo showcasing some of the web components I built for New York Magazine during my internship there in October 2017-January 2018. These components were created for Clay, NYMag's in-house built CMS. Primary technologies used: Handlebars.js, YAML, and Javascript.
